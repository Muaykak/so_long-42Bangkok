# so_long-42Bangkok
This is the so_long project from 42Bangkok coding school

Main objective of this project is to create a basic 2D game 
using MiniLibX

## My journey:

### 1. Understand What is **MiniLibX**

I need to understand first what MiniLibX is what how I can use it

After a bit of looking through the internet
MiniLibX is a small graphical library for 42School

The **MiniLibX** use the Xlib which is the library for Interracting with X Window System
it also provide functions for creating and managing windows, drawing graphics, and handling inputs, 
**miniLibx** is a very small version of Xlib for interacting with X Window System suitable for beginner


Basically the objective is to use function in MiniLibX that project provided to create a basic 2D game that display on screen(obviously lol)

### 2. Understand the **MiniLibX** library

I need to look into the MiniLibX library folder to see how each function is functioning(lol)
